//! - [`soundcard::SoundcardSource`] — live input from a `cpal` device
//! - [`flac::FlacSource`] — realtime playback of a FLAC file, pacing samples
//!   at the file's native rate so downstream DSP sees the same timing as a
//!   live radio
//! - [`stdin_raw::StdinRawSource`] — raw little-endian i16 PCM on stdin
//!
//! Every source runs on a dedicated thread and publishes chunks of samples
//! through a bounded channel. Consumers drain the channel in the demod
//! thread.
