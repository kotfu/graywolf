## 1. Goal

Let an operator point an assistant at their station and have it drive the
receive audio chain to the level that decodes the most packets — automatically
where the chain is software-controllable, and with clear, live, human-readable
guidance where it is not (the radio's volume knob).

When this lands: a user says "tune my packet audio," and the system unmutes the
capture channel if needed, sets the OS capture level and Graywolf's software
gain to land the signal in the decode sweet spot, verifies the result by
actually decoding traffic, and — only if the software knobs can't get there —
tells the user *"turn your radio's volume down a little"* with a live meter that
converges as they turn the knob.

The work splits into three deliverables:

1. A **recording / live-analysis mode** in the existing `graywolf-modem` binary
   (single binary, cross-platform).
2. An **OS audio control layer** (capture level + mute, per platform).
3. An **MCP server** that orchestrates the tuning loop over the Graywolf REST
   API and the OS audio layer, and surfaces guidance to the user/agent.

**Platforms (hard requirement): Linux, macOS, and Windows are all Day-1
first-class** — Graywolf has users on every desktop OS and audio-level pain is
universal, so all three ship in the same release with no "Linux first, others
later" staging (§4.2, §12). **Android is out of scope** (operators don't run MCP
clients from phones), which lets the OS layer target just the three desktop
mixer APIs.

---

## 2. Background — why this is a real problem

Several gain stages sit between the radio and a decoded packet, and they
interact non-linearly. Operators routinely misadjust them, and the existing UI
doesn't tell them how to fix it. The signal chain, upstream → downstream:

| # | Stage | Control | Who sets it | Range |
|---|-------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Radio AF/volume out | analog knob | **human** | continuous |
| 2 | OS capture mute | mixer switch | software | on/off |
| 3 | OS capture level | mixer/ADC gain | software | device-specific dB |
| 4 | Graywolf software gain | DSP multiply | software | −60..+12 dB |
| (W) | Windows "enhancements" | endpoint APOs | software (off) | corrupts audio |

The hard constraints that dictate everything below come from the physics of the
chain, confirmed against `graywolf-modem/src/modem/mod.rs` (`pump_all_audio`):

- **Clipping at the ADC is unrecoverable.** Once samples rail at full scale, no
  downstream knob restores the waveform. A hot signal *must* come down upstream
  (OS level, then radio).
- **Digital boost doesn't improve SNR.** Graywolf's software gain multiplies
  signal *and* noise together, and on positive gain runs the result through a
  `tanh` soft-limiter (`mod.rs` ~L555) — so boosting a too-quiet signal
  distorts the tones before it ever reaches a usable level. A rail-low signal
  *must* come up upstream.
- Therefore **software gain only has authority inside a window** that the
  upstream (OS + radio) stages establish. "Just crank Graywolf's gain" cannot
  be the whole answer; the tuner has to be able to reach the upstream knobs.

---

## 3. Measurement strategy — what we optimize against

Graywolf already exposes two distinct audio measurements. They are *not*
interchangeable, and choosing the right one for each job is the core insight of
this design (it's also what GRA-130 set up).

### 3.1 Per-packet level — the primary signal objective

Source: the demodulator's tone-matched correlator
(`graywolf-modem/src/demod_afsk.rs`: mix → low-pass → magnitude on the mark and
space oscillators, peak-tracked, latched per frame via `set_audio_level`).
Surfaced as `mark_dbfs` / `space_dbfs` / `level_dbfs` on each packet
(`pkg/packetlog`, `GET /api/packets`).

This measures **the AFSK tones we actually decode**, only while a packet is
present — frequency-selective and packet-gated. It is the right number for "is
the signal at a good level." Use the **median `level_dbfs` over a rolling window
of recent decodes** (robust to a single hot/quiet packet). Use the
`mark_dbfs` − `space_dbfs` spread (**twist**) as a *separate diagnostic*: a
persistent imbalance points at radio de-emphasis / audio response, not level.

### 3.2 Device meter — overload guard + acquisition only

Source: broadband peak/RMS over each audio chunk, ~5 Hz
(`pump_all_audio`), exposed as `peak_dbfs` / `rms_dbfs` / `clipping` on
`GET /api/audio-devices/levels`. This is a sound-card VU meter — dominated by
whatever is loudest on the input (hiss, static crashes, adjacent signals), not
your packet. It is the wrong number for the signal objective, but the right
number for two jobs the per-packet measure can't do:

1. **Overload guard.** A clipped tone still carries strong tone energy, so the
   correlator can read a *healthy* `level_dbfs` on a clipped signal. The
   broadband `peak_dbfs` is what catches overload. **Per-packet level sets the
   target; device peak vetoes clipping.**
2. **Acquisition.** Per-packet levels exist only when packets decode. If the
   channel is so misadjusted that nothing decodes, the broadband peak/RMS is the
   only signal available to steer back into range.

### 3.3 Decode counts — ground truth

`GET /api/status` per-channel `rx_frames` (good) and `rx_bad_fcs` (failed FCS).
The good/bad ratio and good-frame rate over a window are the final arbiter:
levels are a proxy; decode count is the thing we actually want to maximize.

### 3.4 Three facts to design around (and small fixes worth making)

Found while tracing `pump_all_audio`:

- **Both meters are post software-gain** (the chunk is gain-adjusted before
  either the meter or the demod sees it). To reason about true ADC headroom
  independent of Graywolf gain, subtract `gain_db` or sample at unity gain.
  Otherwise software gain can mask an upstream level problem.
- **Positive software gain soft-limits via `tanh`** — digital boost distorts
  before it clips. Treat positive gain as a last-resort trim, not a fix.
- **The device `clipping` flag is only evaluated when `gain_db != 0`** (it's
  inside the `if gain_db.abs() > EPSILON` block), so at unity gain it is always
  `false`. The tuner should derive clipping from `peak_dbfs ≳ −0.5` rather than
  trusting the flag. *Optional modem fix: compute `clipping` unconditionally.*

### 3.5 Reference station — a real *working* baseline (NW5W, 2026-06-25)

Read live from a real station (`10.50.0.120`, NW5W-5). It decodes well, but the
operator is explicit that it's **hotter than ideal** and wants the tuner to aim
for a *proper* radio output, not to reproduce his setup. So treat these as a
**calibration data point**, not the target — the value is that they pin the
relationships between the meters, which §3.6 then uses to define "proper."

Active RX device (CM108AH USB, `plughw:CARD=Device`), channel "VHF APRS"
(AFSK 1200), ~4 h uptime, 1443 good frames:

| Quantity | Measured | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Per-packet `level_dbfs` (median) | **−29.7** (−29.6…−29.9, very tight) | a *measurement*, not a quality threshold (see below) |
| `mark_dbfs` / `space_dbfs` | −29.6 / −29.8 | |
| **Twist** \|mark − space\| (median) | **0.2 dB** (max 0.5) | near-perfect tone balance — genuinely a target |
| Graywolf software gain | **−25.5 dB** | large attenuation = the "hot" tell (see §3.6) |
| Device meter `peak_dbfs` | −25.5, `clipping=false` | broadband, post-gain |
| Implied **raw** ADC peak | ≈ **−25.5 − (−25.5) = ~0 dBFS** | **no headroom** — this is what "hot" means |
| `rx_bad_fcs / (good+bad)` | 495 / 1938 ≈ 25% | normal for a busy collision-prone VHF channel |

Three relationships this pins down (these, not the −30, are the durable lessons):

- **Per-packet level tracks the post-gain device peak**, offset ~4 dB low
  (correlator vs broadband): here −29.7 ≈ −25.5 − 4. So per-packet
  `level_dbfs` is *not* a fixed quality setpoint — it slides with the level you
  set. His −30 is a **consequence of running hot then attenuating −25.5 dB**, not
  a number to copy. (My last-turn "aim ≈ −30" over-anchored to his config;
  corrected in §3.6.)
- **Both meters are post software-gain**, so the front-end truth is
  `raw_peak = device_peak − gain_db`. His ≈ 0 dBFS raw → essentially no
  headroom; it works only because no packet has yet peaked into the rail.
- **Negative software gain is clean** (linear, no `tanh`, no SNR cost), which is
  *why* his hot-then-cut chain decodes fine. The problem with "hot" isn't
  distortion or SNR — it's the **missing headroom** (a strong/close station or
  noise burst can clip the ADC), and that a −25.5 dB software trim is *masking* a
  mis-set analog level rather than fixing it.

### 3.6 Target zones — what "proper" means (defaults, operator-overridable)

The real objective is **headroom at the ADC with software gain near unity**, then
let the decoder do its job. The decoder's AGC normalizes a wide input range, so
"louder" is not "better" past the point of adequate SNR — the win is robustness,
not a magic level.

- **Headroom (the "proper" criterion):** drive the analog/OS stage so the
  **raw** ADC peak (`device_peak − gain_db`) sits around **−6 .. −12 dBFS** at
  the loudest normal packets — comfortable margin against clipping on a strong
  station. This is precisely what's wrong on the reference rig (raw ≈ 0).
- **Software gain near unity:** aim `gain_db` within **±~6 dB of 0**. A large
  trim in *either* direction (the reference's −25.5 is the example) means the
  upstream level is mis-set — flag it and fix the analog level, even when decode
  currently looks fine. Negative gain stays the clean direction for small trims;
  positive gain >0 risks `tanh` distortion (§3.4).
- **Per-packet `level_dbfs`:** treat as a **decode-quality indicator, not a
  setpoint** — it must be comfortably above the noise floor and never clipping,
  but its absolute value follows from the headroom choice above (for a proper
  setup expect it *higher* than the reference's −30, roughly −10..−18 depending
  on profile). **Confirm quality by decode count, not by hitting a level.**
- **Twist |mark − space|:** **≤ ~2 dB** excellent (reference 0.2); warn beyond
  ~6 dB (de-emphasis / audio response, not level).
- **Device `peak_dbfs`:** **< −1 dBFS** always (hard clipping veto / acquisition
  — *not* a signal-level target).
- **Decode health:** good-frame *rate* not decreasing and `rx_bad_fcs / rx_frames`
  not increasing across a change (collisions inflate bad-FCS independent of
  level, so weight good-frame rate most).

### 4.1 Single binary for record/decode/monitor — confirmed feasible

`graywolf-modem` already *is* a cross-platform capture engine (cpal:
CoreAudio/ALSA/WASAPI, `audio/soundcard.rs`), already decodes captured audio
through the **production** pipeline (`bench.sh`: file/FLAC source →
`DevicePipeline` → ensemble demod → IPC `ReceivedFrame`), and already produces
both level measurements. So record + decode + count + monitor stay in one
binary. We do **not** ship sox/arecord:

- The modem's cpal path guarantees recorded samples travel the *exact* path the
  decoder uses (same device, rate, format). sox would introduce a second
  device-enumeration world that won't match our cpal `device_path`/`pcm_id`
  naming, plus possible resampling/format drift that silently changes decode
  results.
- No extra binary to package/sign/notarize across platforms.

New surface on the binary:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `--record <dev> --seconds N --out clip.wav` | Capture via cpal, write **WAV PCM s16le** (`hound`). |
| `--decode <clip.wav\|.flac>` | Run clip through the bench/offline pipeline; emit JSON `{rx_frames, rx_bad_fcs, per-packet level_dbfs/mark/space, twist}`. |
| `--monitor <dev>` | Live: stream JSON-lines level stats + directional guidance (§6) while optionally writing the WAV. One session = human-alignment meter **and** decode artifact. |

WAV chosen over FLAC: universal, and avoids a FLAC *encoder* dependency (the
vendored `claxon` is decode-only; the modem only reads FLAC today). For purely
transient tuning captures we can skip the file entirely and feed an in-memory
i16 buffer straight into the pipeline (the `stdin_raw` source proves raw-PCM-in
works). FLAC archival stays a future nicety.

### 4.2 OS audio control layer

This is the one capability neither Graywolf nor cpal provides today (cpal does
capture, not mixer control). Per-platform back ends behind one trait:

```
trait OsAudio {
    fn capture_db_range(dev) -> (min_db, max_db, supported: bool)
    fn get_capture_db(dev)   -> dB
    fn set_capture_db(dev, dB)
    fn get_mute(dev)         -> bool
    fn set_mute(dev, bool)
    fn enhancements_active(dev) -> bool   // Windows only
}
```

**Linux, macOS, and Windows are all Day-1 first-class.** Graywolf has users on
all three and audio-level pain is universal, so the OS layer ships every desktop
back end in the *same* release — none is deferred behind a "Linux first" phase.
Each back end implements the full `OsAudio` trait (level range + get/set, mute
get/set, plus Windows enhancements). Android is **out of scope** — operators
don't drive MCP clients from phones — which also lets us ignore AAudio here and
keep the trait to the three desktop mixer APIs.

| Platform | Back end | Day-1 coverage |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Linux** | vendored **`alsa-rs`** `mixer` for raw ALSA; **`wpctl`/`pactl`** (PipeWire/PulseAudio) for the desktop-routed case | `has_capture_volume` / `set_capture_dB` / `get_capture_dB_range` / **`has_capture_switch`** (mute). Both paths required: headless rigs hit ALSA directly, desktop installs route through PipeWire/Pulse. ALSA needs no new dep. |
| **macOS** | CoreAudio (`coreaudio-sys`): input `kAudioDevicePropertyVolumeScalar` + `kAudioDevicePropertyMute`, addressed per `AudioObjectID` | Full level + mute. |
| **Windows** | WASAPI (`windows` crate): `IAudioEndpointVolume` (`GetMasterVolumeLevelScalar` / `SetMasterVolumeLevelScalar` / `Get/SetMute`) on the capture endpoint; enhancements already detected (`enhancements_enabled`) | Full level + mute + the enhancements precheck. |

Each back end normalizes its native scale (ALSA millibels, CoreAudio 0..1
scalar, WASAPI 0..1 scalar or dB) into the trait's **dB** contract so the state
machine reasons in one unit. cpal already gives us per-host device identity on
all three, which seeds the device→control mapping below.

**Mapping is the sharp edge** (and it is per-OS, so all three need it Day 1).
Graywolf's `device_path` (cpal name + `host_api`) must resolve to the right OS
*mixer control*: an ALSA simple-element / `plughw:`-card on Linux, an
`AudioObjectID` on macOS, an endpoint `IMMDevice` id on Windows. Some USB
adapters expose a single "Mic"/"Capture" control; some expose **none** (fixed
gain) — in that case `set_capture_db` is a no-op and the tuner falls back to
software gain + radio-knob guidance. Every back end must report
`capture_db_range.supported = false` honestly so the state machine can skip
straight to the human step. This "no usable hardware control" path is common
enough (and varies by OS) that it's a first-class outcome, not an error.

Where the layer lives: cleanest is **inside `graywolf-modem`** (it already owns
cpal device identity and has the vendored `alsa-rs`), exposed to the MCP server
either as additional binary subcommands (`--get-capture / --set-capture /
--get-mute / --set-mute`) or via the existing IPC. That keeps "one binary" and
avoids the MCP server re-deriving device identity. The MCP server stays
language-light and just calls it.

### 4.3 Auth / deployment

Graywolf API auth is a **Bearer token** when `BearerToken` is set (desktop
default empty / localhost). MCP config = `{ base_url, token?, device_id }`. OS
mixer access needs appropriate permissions (Linux `audio` group; macOS/Windows
local user). All local-first; nothing leaves the host.

### 4.4 Cross-platform / vendoring constraints (learned from the existing tree)

The modem already carries hard-won portability work, especially for old/32-bit
Raspberry Pi. The OS-control layer must inherit it, not fight it:

- **Linux ALSA goes through the patched `alsa` crate, never stock.** The
  workspace `Cargo.toml` pins `[patch.crates-io] alsa = { git =
  ".../chrissnell/alsa-rs", rev = 56099e8 }` to fix a **t64 `struct timespec`
  stack overflow** that SIGSEGV-crashes capture on current 32-bit Pi OS
  (libasound2t64 — Pi Zero/1/2 and 32-bit Pi 3/4; issue #231,
  `docs/plans/2026-06-11-armhf-t64-alsa-htstamp-fix.md`). The mixer FFI
  (`snd_mixer_selem_*`) we need touches `i64`/MilliBel ranges, **not** timespec,
  so it's outside the crashing path — but the layer must use the *patched* crate
  and we should add an armhf-t64 smoke test for the mixer calls so we don't
  reintroduce the class of bug. Old-Pi support thus comes essentially for free.
- **Avoid new dynamically-linked system libs** — they break the cross/musl
  release toolchain (`Cross.toml`) and old glibc targets. Precedent: `hidapi` is
  pulled with `linux-native-basic-udev` (pure-Rust hidraw, **no libudev link**).
  Apply the same rule here: do the **PipeWire/Pulse** path via `wpctl`/`pactl`
  **subprocess**, not a linked `libpulse`/`libpipewire`, so nothing new has to
  cross-compile for armv6/armhf/musl.
- **Windows reuses the in-tree `windows` 0.59 crate** (already used for PTT and
  the enhancements registry read) — add `Win32_Media_Audio` /
  `Win32_System_Com` features for `IAudioEndpointVolume`; don't introduce a
  parallel `windows-sys`.
- **macOS reuses `coreaudio-sys`** (already in the tree transitively via cpal)
  for the input volume/mute properties — no new top-level dep.
- **Device identity comes from cpal**, which the modem already owns on every
  host, so the OS-control layer maps `device_path`/`host_api` → mixer control in
  the one process that already enumerated the device (avoids a second, drifting
  enumeration world — the same reason §4.1 rejects shipping sox).

Net: the only genuinely new linked code is the per-OS mixer calls themselves
(patched-ALSA mixer, CoreAudio, WASAPI); everything else is subprocess or an
existing dependency, which keeps the old-RPi and cross-compile story intact.

### 4.5 MCP server transport, supervision & management UI

The MCP server runs in Graywolf's own "manage it in the browser" model: Graywolf
owns its lifecycle and the operator turns it on/off and gets a copy-paste client
config from a dedicated tab. Decided with the operator (2026-06-25):

- **Transport — HTTP (streamable-HTTP), not stdio.** The server is a long-lived
  local daemon listening on a port; the AI client connects to it by URL. This is
  what lets *Graywolf* own the process (start/stop/status) rather than the AI
  client spawning it over stdio. stdio is explicitly rejected for this product.
- **Supervision — reuse `pkg/modembridge`'s pattern.** The Go service supervises
  the MCP-server child process exactly as `modembridge`/`supervisor.go` already
  supervises the `graywolf-modem` child: owns the lifecycle, restarts on crash,
  exposes a `Running`/`Restarting`/`Stopped` state. The MCP server is a separate
  Rust binary (§4, §11), so this is the same shape.
- **Persisted toggle — a config singleton.** An `mcp_server` row
  `{ enabled, bind_addr, port }` using the same `FirstOrCreate` singleton pattern
  as `messages_config` / `ax25_terminal_config` (`pkg/configstore`). Flipping
  `enabled` starts/stops the supervised child; the setting survives restarts.
- **Binding — localhost default, 0.0.0.0 opt-in (allowed).** Default
  `127.0.0.1`. The operator may opt into `0.0.0.0` (e.g. to drive the station
  from another machine). Because the server is a **control surface** (it changes
  OS/Graywolf audio levels and reads the station), a non-localhost bind requires
  the bearer token and shows a prominent UI warning; never bind `0.0.0.0`
  silently.
- **Auth — reuse the existing bearer token** (`pkg/webauth`). The tab surfaces
  the token so the operator can paste it into the client config.

**The "MCP Server" tab** (`web/src/routes/McpServer.svelte`, next to Audio
Devices), built on the existing settings-tab + status-endpoint patterns (Igate /
Messages tabs are the template) and a new `mcp-server` REST resource (GET status,
PUT config) backed by the supervisor's state:

1. **Explainer** — what MCP is and that this lets an AI assistant auto-tune the
   station's RX audio.
2. **Status + controls** — live state (running / stopped / restarting), the
   listen `addr:port`, the on/off **toggle**, and the bind-address selector
   (localhost vs 0.0.0.0, with the warning above).
3. **Click-to-copy client configs — an inner tabbed interface**, one sub-tab per
   agent (**Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Cline, Zed,
   and a generic HTTP-MCP** fallback). Each sub-tab renders a ready-to-paste
   snippet **filled with the live host, port, and token**, with a copy button.
   The exact per-agent shape (CLI command vs JSON block, field names) is produced
   at render time from a small per-agent template table, since these formats
   drift across agent releases — the tab is the single place to keep them current.

This is **M4** work (the MCP server milestone, §12); it does not affect M1–M3.

## 5. The tuning state machine

Automatic inner loop (OS level + software gain), human-guided outer loop (radio),
escalating outward only when the inner knobs hit a rail. Decode validation
gates every committed change.

```
0. PRECHECK
   • resolve device → OS mixer control; read capture_db range/support
   • if muted → unmute (or, if no control, prompt user)
   • if Windows enhancements active → prompt user to disable (corrupts AFSK)
   • snapshot current GW gain, OS level, baseline rx_frames/rx_bad_fcs

1. ACQUIRE  (broadband, traffic-tolerant)
   • if no recent decodes: use device peak/rms to get peak into ~ −12..−3 dBFS,
     clipping=false — just enough to start decoding

2. SET HEADROOM at the analog/OS stage  (the "proper" step)
   • goal: raw ADC peak = (device_peak − gain_db) in −12..−6 dBFS at loud
     packets, clipping=false — real margin against strong stations
   • knob priority: OS capture level if the device has one; else this is a
     human-radio step (escalate, §5.5). CM108-class adapters have no capture
     control, so for them "proper" lives entirely on the radio's AF knob.

3. RETURN SOFTWARE GAIN TOWARD UNITY  (fine trim only)
   • once headroom is right, gain_db should land within ±~6 dB of 0. A large
     residual trim means step 2 didn't actually fix the level — go back, don't
     paper over it in software. Negative gain stays clean for small trims;
     avoid >0 dB (tanh, §3.4).

4. VALIDATE  (decode is the arbiter, not a level)
   • hold and watch a window of decodes: good-frame rate not down,
     rx_bad_fcs/rx_frames not up vs the pre-change baseline. Per-packet
     level_dbfs is a sanity indicator, not the pass/fail.
   • for digital-only sweeps, score deterministically on a captured clip (§7)

5. ESCALATE TO HUMAN  (when there's no OS capture control, or it rails)
   • too hot / raw near full-scale / clipping → "turn radio AF output DOWN"
   • too quiet (gain would have to exceed ~+6 dB) → "turn radio AF output UP"
   • target: raw peak ~ −9 dBFS with software gain near 0 (a proper output,
     not a hot one); enter live assist (§6); on each nudge, return to step 1
```

Commit policy: change one knob at a time, dwell, measure, keep only if decode
health holds or improves; otherwise revert. Persist the winning OS level + GW
gain; report the final settings and before/after metrics. A run that decodes
fine but leaves a large software trim should still **report** the rig as "hot —
back the radio down for headroom" rather than silently accepting it (the
reference-station case the operator wants surfaced, not blessed).

---

## 6. Handling the human knob — live tuning assistant

The radio volume is human-controlled, slow, and — critically — each adjustment
re-captures *different* live traffic, so discrete before/after decode counts
aren't comparable across radio changes. The solution is **not** a batch sweep;
it's a continuous loop closed *through the human*:

- The `--monitor` stream reports **robust statistics over a rolling window**
  (e.g. 95th-percentile **raw** ADC peak = device_peak − gain_db, median
  per-packet `level_dbfs`, and clip-rate %) over ~20–60 s — never instantaneous
  values, so a quiet gap or one loud neighbor doesn't jerk the guidance. Raw peak
  is the headline because it's the "proper output" criterion (§3.6).
- It emits a **direction + target range**, never a precise number, and aims for a
  *proper* level (raw peak ~ −9 dBFS, software gain near 0) rather than whatever
  decodes:
  *"Radio's running hot — peaks near full-scale, no headroom. Turn the AF output
  DOWN a little."* Humans can't hit a number and traffic varies; precision is the
  automatic knobs' job afterward.
- Because the user watches a **smoothed live meter converge** rather than
  comparing captures, the "different traffic each time" problem dissolves — it's
  tuning by ear, like peaking an analog signal.

"Can we do it all during capture?" — yes, and that's the clean design: a single
`--monitor` session is simultaneously (a) the WAV writer / decoder feed, (b) the
JSON-lines level+guidance source the MCP server relays to the user, and (c) the
stream the MCP server reads to drive the automatic knobs. One capture, three
uses.

## 7. Offline decode sweep for the digital knobs

Decode-on-recording is deterministic **only on a fixed clip**, which makes it
perfect for the *digital* side: capture once, then apply each candidate software
gain (and/or modem profile) to the *same* samples and `--decode` each —
apples-to-apples, traffic-independent. So:

- **Decode-count scoring** is the objective for the digital knobs (software
  gain, profile) — run on a captured clip.
- **Live dBFS / clip-rate targets** are the objective for the analog knobs (OS
  level coarse, radio) — since each change captures different traffic.
- A **looped reference signal** (a TX playing a known clip, or injecting the
  WA8LMF tracks at the radio) makes even the analog step decode-scoreable for
  gold-standard validation/regression.

## 8. MCP tool surface

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `list_audio_devices` | Graywolf devices + OS-control capability (range, mute, supported?). |
| `get_levels` | Device peak/rms/clipping snapshot (guard/acquisition). |
| `get_packet_levels` | Aggregated recent per-packet `level_dbfs` (median/IQR) + twist. |
| `get_decode_stats` | `rx_frames` / `rx_bad_fcs` deltas over a window. |
| `set_software_gain` | Proxy `PUT /api/audio-devices/{id}/gain`. |
| `get_os_capture` / `set_os_capture` | OS capture level (dB) via the OS layer. |
| `get_mute` / `set_mute` | OS capture switch. |
| `record_clip` / `decode_clip` | Capture a clip / score it offline. |
| `start_monitor` / `read_monitor` | Live level+guidance stream for the human step. |
| `autotune` | Run the §5 state machine end-to-end; returns chosen settings + before/after metrics + any pending human prompt. |

`autotune` is the headline; the rest are the primitives it (and a curious
operator) compose.

## 9. Data contracts

`--monitor` / `--decode` JSON line (stable, versioned):

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "device_id": 1,
  "window_s": 30,
  "gain_db": -25.5,
  "device": { "peak_dbfs": -25.5, "rms_dbfs": -26.3, "clip_rate": 0.0 },
  "raw": { "peak_dbfs": 0.0, "headroom_ok": false, "hot": true },
  "packet": { "n": 24, "level_dbfs_med": -29.7, "level_dbfs_iqr": 0.3,
              "twist_db_med": 0.2 },
  "decode": { "rx_frames": 24, "rx_bad_fcs": 2 },
  "guidance": { "stage": "human_radio", "direction": "down", "reason": "no_headroom",
                "message": "Radio's running hot -- no headroom. Turn the AF output down a little." }
}
```

`raw.peak_dbfs = device.peak_dbfs − gain_db` is the front-end truth; `hot` trips
when raw peak is above ~−6 dBFS or |gain_db| exceeds ~6 (the reference-station
condition). The example above is literally the NW5W reading — decodes fine, but
flagged hot.

`autotune` result: `{ committed: {os_capture_db, gain_db}, raw_peak_dbfs,
hot: bool, before/after: {raw_peak_dbfs, gain_db, level_dbfs_med, rx_frames_rate,
bad_fcs_ratio}, escalations: [...], notes }`.

## 10. Code touch points

- `graywolf-modem`: new `--record` / `--monitor` / `--decode` subcommands
  (reuse `soundcard.rs` capture, bench offline pipeline, existing level paths);
  add `hound` (WAV) and the rolling-stat aggregator; OS-control subcommands/IPC
  over the `alsa-rs` mixer + per-OS back ends. Optional: make the device
  `clipping` flag unconditional (§3.4).
- Graywolf Go service: **no API change required** — `/status`, `/packets`,
  `/audio-devices/levels`, `/{id}/gain` already cover reads + the software-gain
  write. (Possible nicety later: a per-packet WS feed; today only the AX.25
  terminal WS exists, so live per-packet data comes from the modem's own
  `--monitor` stream.)
- New: the MCP server (Rust; §11) + a shared OS-audio-control crate used by both
  the server and `graywolf-modem`.

---

## 11. Decisions (settled) and remaining questions

**Settled with the operator (2026-06-25):**

1. **MCP server language — Rust.** Shares the modem's stack and the patched
   `alsa` crate; mature cross-platform OS-audio crates (`coreaudio-sys`, the
   `windows` crate already in-tree). The OS-control layer is a small crate the
   modem and the MCP server both use — one implementation, all three desktop
   OSes, direct (non-subprocess) bindings everywhere except the Linux
   PipeWire/Pulse path. May use the `creating-mcps` skill.
2. **OS control lives in `graywolf-modem`.** Keeps device identity (cpal, all
   three hosts) and the vendored audio FFI in one place; the MCP server calls it
   via subcommands/IPC (§4.2).
3. **Target model — "proper output," informed by the NW5W reference (§3.5/§3.6):**
   aim for **raw ADC headroom (peak ~ −9 dBFS) with software gain near unity**;
   treat per-packet `level_dbfs` as an indicator (not a setpoint) and confirm by
   decode count; twist ≤ ~2 dB. The reference rig is the *hot* baseline to steer
   away from, not to reproduce.
4. **MCP transport + deployment — HTTP (streamable-HTTP), Graywolf-supervised,
   browser-managed (§4.5).** stdio rejected. Localhost default, **0.0.0.0
   opt-in allowed** (token-gated + warned). Managed from a new "MCP Server" tab
   with a persisted on/off toggle and an inner tabbed, click-to-copy set of
   per-agent client configs. M4 scope.

**Still open:**

4. **Linux PipeWire/Pulse path** — `wpctl`/`pactl` subprocess for v1 vs a
   `libpulse`/PipeWire binding. Subprocess preferred (no new linked dep; see
   §4.4); raw ALSA stays the no-dep direct path for headless rigs.
5. **Reference-signal validation** — is a TX-loopback / WA8LMF-injection harness
   in scope for v1, or just live-traffic + level targets? (Deferred to M5.)

---

## 12. Phasing

**Platform mandate:** the v1 release ships **Linux + macOS + Windows together**.
Phases are sliced by *capability*, and each capability lands on all three OSes
before it's "done" — we don't ship a Linux-only milestone and backfill the
others. Android is excluded (§13). The cross-platform work parallelizes cleanly
because every back end implements the same `OsAudio` trait behind the same
device-mapping seam (cpal identity), so the three can be built and tested
side-by-side rather than serially.

1. **M1 — Recorder + offline score.** `--record` (WAV) and `--decode` (JSON
   score) in `graywolf-modem`. cpal capture + the offline pipeline are already
   cross-platform, so this is tri-OS from the start. Unblocks the deterministic
   digital sweep.
2. **M2 — OS audio layer, all three back ends.** Capture level + mute behind the
   `OsAudio` trait: ALSA (`alsa-rs`) **and** PipeWire/Pulse on Linux, CoreAudio
   on macOS, WASAPI on Windows; device→control mapping + honest `supported`
   reporting on each. `--get/--set-capture` / `--get/--set-mute` subcommands. A
   milestone exit criterion is "all three platforms pass the same control
   smoke test."
3. **M3 — `--monitor` live stats + guidance** stream (§6/§9) — platform-neutral
   (pure DSP/stats), works everywhere M1 does.
4. **M4 — MCP server + `autotune` state machine** (§5/§8), end-to-end on all
   three desktop OSes. Includes the **HTTP-transport server**, its Go-side
   **supervisor** + `mcp_server` config singleton + `mcp-server` REST resource,
   and the **"MCP Server" management tab** (toggle, status, bind-address,
   per-agent click-to-copy configs) per §4.5.
5. **M5 — Hardening + optional reference-signal validation** (TX-loopback /
   WA8LMF injection); per-OS device-quirk coverage (USB adapters with no/odd
   capture controls).

---

## 13. Out of scope (for now)

- **Android.** Operators don't drive MCP clients from phones, so the AAudio
   mixer path is excluded; the OS layer targets only the three desktop APIs.
- Auto-adjusting **TX** audio / deviation (this is RX decode tuning only).
- Touching modem DSP profiles automatically beyond an optional offline sweep.
- A GUI **for the tuning itself** — the auto-tune *interaction* stays the
  MCP/agent conversation. (Note: there **is** a management UI — the "MCP Server"
  tab of §4.5 — for enabling the server and copying client configs. That's
  enable/connect plumbing, not a tuning GUI.)
